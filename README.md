A comprehensive repository showcasing the personal projects of **Asutosh Ghimire**.  


## Projects  

### MiniNet

This subdirectory currently includes a fully ground up implementation of a Neural Network in C.

Contains implementations of core data structures, algorithms, and systems programming tasks. Emphasis on performance and modularity for reuse in larger applications.

## Current Work  
### Neural Network Framework Implementation (C)  
Currently building a custom neural network framework under the `MiniNet` subdirectory.  
- Designed with future integration of **parallel programming** paradigms, including **CUDA** and **OpenMP**, for high-performance C
- Interfaces with a shared ctype python library for ease of use and visualization.
